# Supervise-learning

I upload two projects here. The first one is a house price prediction system named supervise_learning_for_competition. A lot of different factors are considered here to make it able to predict if the house will be expensive or not. Feature Enginnering and ML-Model are applied. The second one is one extra test data from another quite similar test to check the accuracy even to some small changes in variables. In both projects are the decision tree method applied. Mushroom classification is another project based on the features of different mushrooms to predict a new group of mushrooms in whether they are possionous or not. Good regression model is one ML-Model which has a very good performance for the house price prediction.
